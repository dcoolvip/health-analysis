# Health Data Analysis

This project analyzes health data to predict the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) using machine learning models.

## Overview

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection of risk factors can help in prevention and management. This project utilizes the Framingham Heart Study dataset to develop predictive models for assessing the risk of CVD based on various health indicators.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- Model training: Machine learning models, such as Random Forest, are trained on the preprocessed data to predict the likelihood of developing CVD.
- Model evaluation: The performance of the trained models is evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
- Visualization: The project includes visualizations to showcase interesting trends and insights in the health data.

## Installation
